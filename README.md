## Contact form â†’ Telegram

This project includes a contact form that submits to a Telegram chat via a bot.

1) Create a bot with BotFather and obtain the token.
2) Add the bot to your group/channel and promote if needed. Send a test message so the chat gets an update.
3) Set environment variables (copy `.env.example` to `.env`):

```
NUXT_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC...
NUXT_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=-1001234567890
```

4) Restart the dev server after setting env vars.

Notes:
- Server endpoint: `POST /api/contact` expects `{ name, phone, comment? }`.
- Basic validation occurs on both client and server.
- On success, a notice appears in the UI and the message is sent via Telegram Bot API.
